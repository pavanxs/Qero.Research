# Qero Research: Decentralized Document Marketplace

## Project Overview
Qero Research is a decentralized marketplace for high-value documents, enabling users to upload PDFs (e.g., research papers, legal briefs, corporate reports), set custom prices, and allow others to search, preview, and purchase access. It uses Filecoin Storage for immutable, verifiable document storage and Filecoin Pay for seamless, on-chain paymentsâ€”creating a transparent alternative to centralized platforms that lack ownership guarantees or efficient discovery.

**Core Goal:** Empower creators to monetize intellectual property while providing buyers with reliable access to premium knowledge. By integrating decentralized storage with smart search, Qero Research addresses gaps in trust, cost, and usability in document sharing.

## Problem Definition
Valuable documents are often trapped in expensive, centralized platforms with limited access and creator control. Buyers encounter:
- **Access Barriers:** Recurring fees or limited previews on sites like Academia.edu or ResearchGate.
- **Creator Disempowerment:** No easy way to sell content without intermediaries or IP risks.
- **Inefficient Search:** Keyword-based tools yield irrelevant results, wasting time in fields like academics or legal.
- **Trust Gaps:** Centralized systems can't verify authenticity or prevent unauthorized use.

This impacts real users: Researchers struggle with paywalls, businesses overpay for reports, and creators lose revenue to platforms. For decentralized storage, it highlights needs for verifiable retrieval and integrated payments.

## Solution & Value Proposition
Qero Research offers a fair marketplace where creators upload documents, set prices, and earn directly via Filecoin Pay. Buyers search, preview, and pay for access. Key features include:
- Smart Previews: Summaries or excerpts before purchase.
- Flexible Pricing: Per document, section, or query.
- Ownership Proof: On-chain verification via Filecoin.
- Analytics: Insights for creators on usage.

**Why Filecoin?** It builds on warm storage and payments for composable services, ensuring decentralized reliability.

**Value:** Buyers get targeted access at lower costs; creators earn transparently; the ecosystem gains a sustainable model.

## Technical Design & Filecoin Integration
**Architecture Overview:**
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js for dashboards, search, and payments. Uses Synapse SDK for Filecoin interactions.
- **Backend:** Node.js API for search and retrieval. Deploys on Filecoin's cloud.
- **Storage & Retrieval:** Filecoin Warm Storage with PDP; FilCDN for fast access.
- **Payments:** Filecoin Pay for secure, on-chain transactions.
- **AI/Semantic Functionality:** Integrates semantic search (e.g., vector embeddings for context-aware queries) and AI for intelligent previews/summaries (using models like GPT or open-source alternatives). Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance query responses by pulling relevant document snippets.
- **Security:** Encryption, access controls, Filecoin SLAs.

**Integration Depth:** Synapse SDK manages uploads/retrieval/payments. Full-stack use of Filecoin primitives for verifiability.

**System Diagram (High-Level):**
```
[Upload] ? [Synapse SDK] ? [Filecoin Storage]
[Search] ? [AI Engine (Semantic/RAG)] ? [Preview via FilCDN] ? [Pay via Filecoin Pay] ? [Access]
```

This ensures scalability, documentation, and best practices.

## GTM & Cohort Alignment
Targets research/legal/corporate users with partnerships. Aligns with cohort by validating Filecoin Onchain Cloud for real problems and providing feedback.

## Existing Competitors
Focusing on general document marketplaces:

1. **Scribd**: Valuation ~$500M-$1B; Revenue ~$200M. Strong in user content but lacks decentralized storage or semantic AI.
2. **Academia.edu**: Valuation $50M-$100M. Revenue from ads; ~10M users, but no creator monetization or advanced search.
3. **ResearchGate**: Valuation ~$1B+; Revenue ~$100M. Acquired for ~$471M; focuses on networking with paywalls, no fine-grained access.

## Advantages of Qero Research
- **Decentralized Ownership:** Unlike Scribd/Academia.edu's centralized control, Filecoin ensures creators own data with on-chain proofs, reducing piracy risks.
- **Integrated Payments:** Filecoin Pay enables direct, low-fee monetization vs. ResearchGate's high platform cuts.
- **Semantic AI Features:** Advanced search and AI previews (e.g., context-aware queries, summaries) outperform keyword-only tools, delivering faster, more accurate results than all three.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Buyers pay per need (e.g., $0.50/section) vs. subscriptions; creators earn transparently without ads.
- **Scalability & Trust:** Filecoin's verifiable storage solves authenticity issues, making it more reliable for high-stakes docs than private platforms.
